# Credit Card Web Service client

This is a Java Web Service client

The client uses the wsimport tool (included with the JDK since version 6)
to generate classes that can invoke the web service and
perform the Java to XML data conversion.

The client needs access to the WSDL file,
either using HTTP or using the local file system.
